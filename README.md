### Hi there, I'm John 👋

Sometimes I'm a software engineering executive / senior manager. I’ve built and scaled high-performing teams of software engineers, shaped engineering culture, and driven technical strategy in VC-backed startups and multi-billion-dollar enterprises. I’m known for taking on underperforming teams and turning them into confident, capable, and effective engineering organisations.

Sometimes I'm a principal level IC. I've solved some hard technical problems around AI for planet-scale network optimisation and for low-latency software in finance. 

- I'm currently building a set of resources and guidance to help software engineers leverage [AI-Assisted software engineerng](https://github.com/JohnCrickett/ai-assisted-engineering).
- I'm also building a set of [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi) to help developers become better software engineers through building real applications.
- I run a [YouTube channel for Coding Challenges]([https://codingchallenges.fyi](https://www.youtube.com/@codingchallengesfyi)) that has videos about [AI-assisted software engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeHPbm9WBggKsdenPr8lTSrw04dIyl5gI) as well as programming projects and coding chllenges.
- I host a podcast about software engineering, it's called Coding Chats and you can find it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@codingchats) or your favourite podcast platform.
- I've worked in many programming languages, current regulars are Go, Python and Rust. Before that I did a lot of C++ and occasionally, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Perl, Visual Basic, Delphi, Pascal, and C.
