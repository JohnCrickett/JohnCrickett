### Hi there, I'm John 👋

Sometimes I'm a software engineering executive / senior manager. I’ve built and scaled high-performing teams of software engineers, shaped engineering culture, and driven technical strategy in VC-backed startups and multi-billion-dollar enterprises. I’m known for taking on underperforming teams and turning them into confident, capable, and effective engineering organisations.

Sometimes I'm a principal level IC. I've solved some hard technical problems around AI for planet-scale network optimisation and for low-latency software in finance. 

- I've worked in many programming languages, current regulars are Go, Python and Rust. Before that I did a lot of C++ and occasionally, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Perl, Visual Basic, Delphi, Pascal, and C

- I'm currently building a set of [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi) to help developers become better software engineers through building  real applications.
